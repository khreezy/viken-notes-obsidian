    - [[Eir]] finds some information about other accounts of contacts from entities from other planes, in the form of dreams, items going missing, people traveling in forests going missing without any word. any creature that has the ability to communicate across planes would be a very powerful creature
    - in order for beings to communicate across the planes you can't just shout across the planes, you have to have some knowledge or connection to a person/creature/being to contact them 
    - there are many different planes, some of them are more "scary" than others.
    - there are elemental planes, feywild, shadowfell, aasgard, niflheim, 
    - the abyss, the astral sea

        - [[Luckbringer]] is a light blade, not one of immense power like the hammer or spear, but one that brings immense luck to someone who wields it. only one individual has ever touched it, but there is no written record of the person as if they were struck from history
