I passed around [SIMPS](content/Organizations/SIMPS.md) literature in the [Sootswallow Lodge](content/Places/Sootswallow%20Lodge.md)
- Fraeyda crushed a bagpipe performance
- [Fraeyda](content/PCs/Fraeyda.md), [Royson](content/PCs/Royson.md), and [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md) won a drinking competition
- Learned that [Freya Ãšlfur](content/NPCs/Freya%20%C3%9Alfur.md)'s birthday is soon
- [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) was looking for a strange character, who turned out to be [Pasha](content/NPCs/Pasha.md)
- I followed [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) and [Pasha](content/NPCs/Pasha.md) upstairs in the form of [Trotsky](content/PCs/Trotsky.md)
- Pasha offered [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) an item and gold in turn for going to a warehouse run by [The Myriad](content/Organizations/The%20Myriad.md)
- [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) set a bed on fire trying to get rid of [Trotsky](content/PCs/Trotsky.md)
- We accepted [Pasha](content/NPCs/Pasha.md)'s proposal and went to the [Eastern Edge Warehouse](content/Places/Eastern%20Edge%20Warehouse.md)
- We went to the warehouse, and they tried to shake us down for 500g instead of the 300g agreed upon
- [Fraeyda](content/PCs/Fraeyda.md) attacked them
- We killed four of the thugs
- In searching, we found 8x50g gems, a scroll of shield, and some silvered weapons
- Ended the session by finding a [Baby Basilisk](content/NPCs/Baby%20Basilisk.md)
