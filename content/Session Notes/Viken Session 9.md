- took the [Trigoat Trail](content/Places/Trigoat%20Trail.md) to find the Orcs
- [Orcs](Orcs) are good at pack battle tactics
- [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md) found the entrance to the [Star Metal Mine](content/Places/Star%20Metal%20Mine.md) in the woods on the way to the orcs
- there is a sign on the mine entrance aying it is the worker's entrance
- gem dust next to the entrance to the mine
    - some grafitti on the walls, mostly says DANGER
    - symbol on top of the wooden bar carved too high of the symbol of a dagger surrounded by 3 eyes
    - same symbol of a note found on a note on [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md)'s door
    - no necromantic magic
    - faint traces of divination magic
    - probably a potent magical presence deeper in the mountain, but too far away
    - lots of different types of grafitti, names, dates, cairns. 
    - kind of a makeshift memorial site for the lost people of the mine
    - little face is just graffitti 
- sign post on the road says old owl well to the left and wyvern tour to the right 
- underneath the old owl well 
- [Human](content/Species/Human.md)s arrived on [Viken](Viken.md) only ~500 years ago
- dwarves and elves are ancient peoples
- pockets of Viken feature remnants of pasts from old peoples
- the [Old Owl Well](content/Places/Old%20Owl%20Well.md) could perhaps be some old ruins
    - perhaps ruins of a watch tower
    - maybe a zombie wizard?
- we are in the [Brekka Mountains](content/Places/Brekka%20Mountains.md)
- [Trotsky](content/PCs/Trotsky.md) spotted a rim mouth where the orcs are probably in a cave
