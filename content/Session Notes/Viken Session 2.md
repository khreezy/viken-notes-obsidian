- Started off by deciding to stuff the [Baby Basilisk](content/NPCs/Baby%20Basilisk.md) in [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md)'s bag and taking it with us
- Escaped notice from the guards by [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) using presitidigitation and me using minor illusion to distract them while we ran out
- went to [Sofia](content/NPCs/Sofia.md) and [Ekaterina](content/NPCs/Ekaterina.md)'s shop, where Ekaterina advised us to finish our business with [Pasha](content/NPCs/Pasha.md)
- Went and dropped off the box of silvered weapons with [Pasha](content/NPCs/Pasha.md)
- [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) got some sort of magical broach as well as the gold in exchange
- Stayed the night at the [Sootswallow Lodge](content/Places/Sootswallow%20Lodge.md)
- In the morning, [Fraeyda](content/PCs/Fraeyda.md) and I journeyed back to [Ekaterina](content/NPCs/Ekaterina.md)'s shop
- Before we left, [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md) asked us to find a book on taking care of the [Baby Basilisk](content/NPCs/Baby%20Basilisk.md)
- When we arrived, [Ekaterina](content/NPCs/Ekaterina.md) asked us if we could look into her employee [Sildar](content/NPCs/Sildar.md)'s absence
    - she sent him to fetch an item from [Berufell](content/Places/Berufell.md) but he should have arrived two days ago and has not been seen since
- I bought a 100g worth of magical ink/paper and a scroll of identify
- Talked to my mom, [Sofia](content/NPCs/Sofia.md), who I haven't seen in 40 years. promised i would be back soon
- We left to meet the others at the south gate of Ifyr
- On the way, we stopped at [The Dusty Tome](content/Places/The%20Dusty%20Tome.md), where we bought [Volo's Guide to Monsters](content/Objects/Volo's%20Guide%20to%20Monsters.md) for [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md)
- Upon arriving at the gate, it became clear that it was one of the more heavily guarded gates because it is the closest to the [Black Sands Alliance](content/Places/Black%20Sands%20Alliance.md)
- I attempted to cast a poorly planned illusion to give the appearance of a regular, open bag when we were going through the gate
- [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) had to come in and save be my charming the guard and distracting him into letting me through
- After making our way out of the city, we decided to skirt around and head towards [Berufell](content/Places/Berufell.md)
- The guards spotted us skirting the city and we were noted
- We traveled for the rest of the day until coming upon a overturned cart with dead horses and a sign for [Ekaterina](content/NPCs/Ekaterina.md)'s Esoterica on it
    - clearly this was [Sildar](content/NPCs/Sildar.md)'s cart
- We searched the cart but were then attacked by a few goblins
- We managed to kill the goblins easily, with [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md) absolutely massacring one of them
- During the fight, [Fraeyda](content/PCs/Fraeyda.md) healed a Dwarf who was unconscious in the wreckage, who proceeded to nut check a goblin to death
- Also during the fight, [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md) caused a small fire in the woods. This seemed to anger [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md) who then attacked [Royson](content/PCs/Royson.md)
- After the fight, the [Baby Basilisk](content/NPCs/Baby%20Basilisk.md) was squirming a lot and we unsuccessfully attempted to calm it down, whereupon it bit [Bug](content/PCs/Bug.md)'s finger and has just escaped the bag
    - we are planning on releasing the [Baby Basilisk](content/NPCs/Baby%20Basilisk.md) somewhere near [Berufell](content/Places/Berufell.md)
