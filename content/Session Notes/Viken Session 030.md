- we are followed by scouts as we leave the city
- cruel to taunt a man who is already who, who who she cantrsut but do you know the same 
- [[The Quill]] is potentially the [[Baroness Tuakon]] master of industry, the [[Jemma Ursor]] master of diplomacy, or [[Zivan Margolyn]] master of the arcane
- [[Well of Urd]] is the well of fate
    - the planes are connected through [[Yggdrasil]]
        - [[Niflheim]], [[Asgard]], [[Midgard]]
    - the well is beneath the root of [[Yggdrasil]] and the gods meet at the well and have their council
    - stories say that the root of [[Yggdrasil]] that touches [[Midgard]] touches it in [[Jotunheim]]
    - this is why nobody can reach [[Asgard]]
    - wellspring of all knowledge in the universe
    - [[Odin]] himself traded his own eye for one drink from the well
    - after one drink he became the all father, all knowing, etc.
- the trees that attack us say [[Zahir Mistfont]] is gone, we defend ourselves now
    - also "we are fighting its pull, we are not strong enough we will not be able to stop it"
    - "you must stop it, you must stop ragnarok"
    - we find the Field notes and wanderings of [[Zahir Mistfont]]
