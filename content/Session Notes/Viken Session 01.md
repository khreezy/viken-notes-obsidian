I passed around [[SIMPS]] literature in the [[Sootswallow Lodge]]
- Fraeyda crushed a bagpipe performance
- [[Fraeyda]], [[Royson]], and [[Bug]] won a drinking competition
- Learned that [[Freya Ãšlfur]]'s birthday is soon
- [[Eir]] was looking for a strange character, who turned out to be [[Pasha]]
- I followed [[Eir]] and [[Pasha]] upstairs in the form of [[Trotsky]]
- Pasha offered [[Eir]] an item and gold in turn for going to a warehouse run by [[The Myriad]]
- [[Eir]] set a bed on fire trying to get rid of [[Trotsky]]
- We accepted [[Pasha]]'s proposal and went to the [[Eastern Edge Warehouse]]
- We went to the warehouse, and they tried to shake us down for 500g instead of the 300g agreed upon
- [[Fraeyda]] attacked them
- We killed four of the thugs
- In searching, we found 8x50g gems, a scroll of shield, and some silvered weapons
- Ended the session by finding a [[Baby Basilisk]]
