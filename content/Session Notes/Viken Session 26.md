- centuries ago, an Engwyn without the coloring and scales
- [[Selen Engwyn Sr.]] was the name of the Engwyn who made the deal
- [[Fraeyda]] asks for power that has been unattainable for any mortals, when the world was ruled by dragons
- in exchange for [[Morwen]]'s safety and sanctuary, and a place to feed. she feeds on grief and despair
- the [[Hall of Echoes]] is the place of mourning for the elves, which naturally feeds [[Morwen]]

- [[Damianna Ulfur]] is from [[Rond]]
- her hair is dyed, she's pale, her eyes are an amber color and the same as the queen's
- she's a princess!
- [[Damianna Ulfur]] couldn't stay in [[Rond]], she didn't know where she could go that she wouldn't be fund. 
- 20 years ago, she struck up a friendship with an Elf that she knew from traveling
- if [[Hel]] calls her, she will go where she is needed

- they have a daughter (presumably [[Damianna Ulfur]]?)
- the lineage of the line runs through the women
- [[Freya Úlfur]] took the throne in 498 after the untimely death of [[Solveig]]
- she was the youngest monarch
- 2 years after she took the throne, the [[Great War]] started
- [[King Hrothgar]] does the diplomacy and head of state stuff
- [[Daewen Ulfur]] was a young child when he was killed 
- their daughter [[Damianna Ulfur]] is still alive...and presumably [[Damianna Ulfur]]? 
- [[Damianna Ulfur]] was born maybe right when the war ended or imediately following it
- seen as a sign that the gods were smiling on the kingdom blessing them with a daughter
- [[Damianna Ulfur]] was the high priestess of the [[Kingdom of Úlfurfold]], the communicator between the [[Aesir]] and the kingdom
- 18 months ago, [[Damianna Ulfur]] vanished from the public eye
-   the people that [[Damianna Ulfur]] was serving and speaking had no interest in...
- the [[Great War]] ended, but not for her mother or the gods
- it was important that people believed the war ended 
- before she left, she saw visions from [[Hel]] and the land beyond, [[Niflheim]]. She saw the armies of the dead, their spirits piling thousands deep. she saw fire, death, at scales unimaginable, the destruction of the world itself. 
- she saw bodies, carcasses being consumed from the inside out
- when she said what she had seen, they called her mad, and that she was a false prophet
- the visions got worse, but nobody wanted to hear them. she kept saying the same things to the same people. eventually, they were going to make her stop saying them
- the elves have listened, but they don't have spirituality so she doesn't know if they believe her.
- [[Freya Úlfur]]'s response was to send troops west
- [[Damianna Ulfur]]/[[Damianna Ulfur]] doesn't want the fires to burn at all
- there's fire in the visions, so we are guessing it is [[Surtur]]
- she doesn't know if there's some level of cruelty or moral chaos that needs to be reached before something happens
