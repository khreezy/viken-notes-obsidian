### Notes

- Encountered underneath the mansion in [[Berufell]]
- Ran away from us on first encounter
- Seemed to be working away on making potions of disguise self underneath the [[Mansion]] in [[Berufell]]
- Found a note [[Viken Session 11]] in his chest under [[Mansion]] that said:
	- awaiting updates on your project, will you be able to fill the necessary request by the Queen's birthday? I've heard the goblins who have your lover are not patient when they are hungry
	- implies that his lover was [[Sildar]]
- Found a note in [[Viken Session 11]] saying:
	- Lord Albrecht, my spies in Ifyr tell me that strangers are on their way
	- probably related to [[Pasha]]? how did they know we were coming?

>[!Note from Black Spider]
>"Lord Albrek, My spies in Ifyr tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Berufell in a few days' time. They could be working for the crown. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don't allow them to upset our plans. See that any maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I'm counting on you, Glasstaff. Don't disappoint me." - BLACK SPIDER DRAWING
