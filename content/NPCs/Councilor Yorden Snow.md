### Notes 

- Local ruler of [Kvikvik](content/Places/Kvikvik.md)
- seems to have some sort of past with both the [Royson family](Royson%20family), [Royson](content/PCs/Royson.md) himself, and [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md)
- Sent a note to [Elyssa Engwyn](content/NPCs/Elyssa%20Engwyn.md)
	-  I’m very sorry to hear you won’t be joining our most recent venture, Taskhand. I assure you, it promises extraordinary profits for the right investors. I ask only that you keep an open mind regarding the [Northern Expedition](content/Events/Northern%20Expedition.md). Perhaps, if we can prove the values of exploration, you will reconsider the participation of your people. And if the [Court of Stars](content/Organizations/Court%20of%20Stars.md) is uninterested in an official capacity, know that your private investment will always be welcome. [Guildmaster Harold Royson](content/NPCs/Guildmaster%20Harold%20Royson.md) and I will keep our offer on the table through the end of the season, if you change your mind. - Councilor Snow
