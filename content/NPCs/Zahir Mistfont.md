### Notes

> [!Note on Body]
>  “…I saw it all at once, this magnificent open temple lined with wooden pews. A bright flame flickering at the back of the hall opposite me. And before me, The Pit. [The Endless](content/Objects/The%20Endless.md). Its call is silent, but has yet to leave my mind. I need to look closer. This will be my last letter. Tell [Tabitha](content/NPCs/Tabitha.md) her father was a fool.”
