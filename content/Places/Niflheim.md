The lowest of the three worlds in Asgardian cosmology, Niflheim is home to [[Hel]]. [[Hel]] is both the land of the dead and the name of the deity who rules it, and [[Hel]] can be found right at the border where Niflheim touches the [[Midgard]]. Those who die of sickness, old age, or accident come to Niflheim for judgment by Hel in her hall Eljudnir.
