# Description

Known colloquially as ʻThe Gold Cityʼ,  
Gullborg is the center of the Black Sands  
Alliance. A town of merchants, adventurers,  
retired soldiers, actors, professional  
companions, thieves, orphans, and people and  
races of all sorts. Its key geography makes it a  
popular destination for many, and when within  
the city limits, even tieflings, goblins, and  
half-orcs can feel safe roaming freely. All of the  
buildings in Gullborg are painted the same gold  
color, lending the city its name
