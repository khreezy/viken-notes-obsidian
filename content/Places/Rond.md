# Description

Capital City of Úlfurfold, in the central  
eastern part of the continent. This is where the  
King and Queen live. Well-fortified, with a wall  
surrounding the city. Home to many families,  
primarily humans, halflings, and dwarves.  
Elves, tieflings, half-orcs, and other  
less-common creatures can expect some level of  
hostility or suspicion from the residents of  
Rond. The area surrounding Rond is largely  
made up of farming families. Food is plentiful,  
winters are long and harsh but summers are  
cool and lovely.
