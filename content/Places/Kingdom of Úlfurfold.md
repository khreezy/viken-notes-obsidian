# Description 

For over five hundred years, human clans in  
varying states of organization have inhabited  
Viken. About 150 years ago, in approximately  
380 P.D., a clan of fierce Wolf warriors, the Úlfur  
Clan led by King Asger Úlfur, began coalescing  
power and expanding their influence. Through a  
combination of raiding, diplomacy, and  
mutually-beneficial arrangements, their power  
gradually increased. Under the guidance of the  
divine beings Odin and Balder, the Úlfurs were  
able to expand their civilization, make moderate  
magical advancements, grow more plentiful  
food and gain more powerful means of  
protection.  

Other rulers have come and gone, but few have  
made as immediate and lasting a mark as King  
Hrothgar Úlfur and Queen Freya Úlfur. Aer  
assuming the throne in 498 P.D., their rule was  
immediately threatened by a near world-ending  
cataclysm that claimed the lives of many.  
Armies led by Queen Freya (and divine  
intervention) saved the world, and the citizens  
of Úlfurfold are incredibly grateful to their king  
and queen for their survival.  
Úlfurfold has increased its military presence,  
particularly to the west of the continent. A  
shortage of certain precious metals, including  
silver, has made some kinds of armor and  
weaponry expensive or even impossible to find  
for those not serving in the army.
