# Description

The Savaliere Woods lie to the far east of Viken.  
The elvish society has inhabited these woods for  
thousands of years, long before the Divergence  
and long before humans stepped foot on the  
continent. Rather secretive and secluded, few  
travelers make their way to the woods, as it is  
well known that the elves are rather hostile to  
outsiders, particularly non-magical creatures.
