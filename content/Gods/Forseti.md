## The Peacemaker (he/him)

### Description

Forseti, son of Balder, has never told a lie. The gods call on Forseti to be impartial in all things. Thus, he is the God of Justice, and acts as Chief Justice of the Aesir. Forseti is an even-tempered god, but is easily enraged when confronted with injustice and chaos. While not nearly as beautiful as his father, Forseti’s wisdom and judgment are unparalleled.

Forseti’s followers are devoted to justice over everything, including their own god. They trust in their own judgment as sacrosanct. Level-headedness is one of Forseti’s founding principles, and he teaches all who care to learn about the benefits of impartiality and decisiveness.

### Worshippers

Paladins, judges, halflings, all those who seek knowledge in the name of peace and fairness. Forseti’s clergy believe in justice, though they respect Asgardian traditions of revenge. They often act as judges, intermediaries, and arbitrators for their communities. The clergy are quick to protect those involved in disputes, insisting that no one is guilty without a fair trial.

Forseti’s temples resemble courtrooms and often serve as the same. They contain small rooms for legal discussions and settlements, libraries of local laws, and armories. Visitors to Forseti’s temples find them quieter and more restrained than other Asgardian temples, particularly if court is in session. Those seeking assistance in resolving a dispute can request a private conference with at least one member of the clergy/

Forseti’s cult believes that ethics and morality originate from the lawmakers and rulers. True justice can only come from staying impartial. His worshipers teach the value of judges and arbitrators to society, and seek to develop the same unbiased sense of justice through Forseti’s teachings.

### Depiction

Forseti is not nearly as beautiful as his father, but his calm nature and level-headed wisdom make him an appealing god all the same. Well-trimmed hair and beard, as well as simple but clean clothing are present in images of him. Many images depict him sitting in solemn judgment, his expression always neutral and attentive. Depictions show Forseti’s eyes always covered, representing the blind and impartial nature of justice.

### Commandments

- True power comes from knowledge. Seek to learn all you can so you may be a better arbiter of truth and justice.
