## Mother of the Forge (she/her)

### Description

Skadi is a female giant whose father Sleipnir built the great walls protecting Asgard. As the only creature with knowledge of Asgard’s defenses, upon completion of the project, Thor killed him.

Skadi came to Asgard seeking revenge against Thor for killing her father. When she arrived at Asgard in her hand-crafted armor she so impressed the gods that they offered her her pick of the bachelor gods if she would not go to war against them. The only condition was that she could only see their feet when she made her choice. Thinking the cleanest, whitest feet must belong to Balder, the kindest and gentlest god, she made her choice only to discover they belonged to the older god Njord, whose feet the sea washed clean every day. They married, but Njord and Skadi were an ill-matched pair. He loved the seashore, and she loved the mountains. Because they couldn’t agree on a place to live, Njord and Skadi moved back and forth between the mountains of Midgard and the seas of Asgard. Their marriage did not last long, and Skadi divorced him and married Uller, goddess of winter and the hunt.

As the Mother of the Forge, Skadi’s domain is over earth and the mountains and all things made from it. Her followers devote themselves to the making of fine armor and weaponry, as Skadi and her worshippers believe one must always be ready for battle. But preparedness doesn’t mean you must eschew beauty and luxury.

### Worshippers

Dwarves, druids, craftspeople and smiths. Though most of Skadi’s followers are skilled warriors, they rarely enter combat unless absolutely necessary. Temples to her are found in the mountains, and are always built from local materials and blend into the landscape.

### Depiction

Depictions of Skadi vary from city to city, but a few features are universal. A descendant of giants, she is always drawn as a large and imposing figure, with wild, dark hair, usually with her forging hammer raised, poised to strike. Any depiction of her originating with the dwarves of Faerun also shows Skadi with a full, intricately-braided beard. All dwarves, regardless of sex, take extraordinary pride in their beards, with fullness often indicating success on the battlefield. Skadi’s beard in their artwork is incomparably impressive.

The dwarves of Viken are particularly devout followers of Skadi, and it is said that the entire mountain city of Faerun is one large temple to Skadi.

### Commandments

-   Respect for the community and the clan must balance with a respect for nature and its unpredictability. 
-   Keep your allies close. The community is always stronger than the individual.
-   The most beautiful things in the world come from what we forge with our own hands. Learn what skills you possess so that you may better enrich the world around you.
-   Always be prepared for battle, for the best defense is a good offense.
