### Notes

- Hag we encountered underneath [[Oaken Heart]] in the [[Hall of Echoes]]
- Revealed secrets about [[Fraeyda]], [[Elyssa Engwyn]], and [[Selen Engwyn Sr.]] 
- Made a deal with the [[Engwyn]]s for safety in exchange for grief and despair, hence the [[Hall of Echoes]], a place of mourning for [[High Elves]] of [[Tel-Quessir]]
