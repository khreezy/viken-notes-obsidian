### Notes 

- Local ruler of [[Kvikvik]]
- seems to have some sort of past with both the [[Royson family]], [[Royson]] himself, and [[Eir]]
- Sent a note to [[Elyssa Engwyn]]
	-  I’m very sorry to hear you won’t be joining our most recent venture, Taskhand. I assure you, it promises extraordinary profits for the right investors. I ask only that you keep an open mind regarding the [[Northern Expedition]]. Perhaps, if we can prove the values of exploration, you will reconsider the participation of your people. And if the [[Court of Stars]] is uninterested in an official capacity, know that your private investment will always be welcome. [[Guildmaster Harold Royson]] and I will keep our offer on the table through the end of the season, if you change your mind. - Councilor Snow
