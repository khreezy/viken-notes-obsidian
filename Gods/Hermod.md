## The Lucky (they/them)

### Description

Hermod, the messenger god, is  another god of luck and trickery. They have spent most of their life playing second-fiddle to the notorious god Loki. Loki’s betrayal and subsequent fall from grace has not coincided with an increased interest in Hermod’s teachings — if anything, the opposite is true. Mistrust abounds towards Hermod and their (rather limited) band of followers, but the god of luck doesn’t care. They revel in the unknown, the downtrodden, the lucky and unlucky in equal measure. Hermod doesn’t care about their followers’ professions, backgrounds, or alignment. Like all good messengers, they fulfill their duty quickly and without questioning motives or passing judgment.

Hermod hasn’t been known to bless many of their followers; as a god of luck and trickery, it takes quite an extraordinary person to impress this deity. They reward audacity, confidence, and the chaotic boldness of those who seek out pleasure above all else.

### Worshippers

Bards, rogues, messengers, heralds, travelers. With few followers and even fewer devout worshippers, shrines and temples dedicated to Hermod are rare and scattered, usually long-since abandoned. Followers of Hermod shirk standard worship practices, instead usually offering worship through intensely clever ticks or daring, nearly-impossible audacious feats.

### Depiction

Hermod is most often depicted as a tan-skinned androgynous figure. Alternating between masculine and feminine dress, Hermod’s sharp eyes and sharp smile are the only thing consistent in how this deity is drawn.

### Commandments

- Luck favors the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, and to do so is to have Hermod behind you.
- Let the shadows protect you from the burning light of fanatical good and the absolute darkness of evil.
- Walk unbridled and untethered, forging new memories and experiences with every forward step.
