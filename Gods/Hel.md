## Goddess of the Underworld (she/her)

### Description

Master of the skein of fate and the mistress of winter, Hel is the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the border between life and death and ensuring the natural transition is undefiled. Many funerals ask her blessing to protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath.

While she has no grand temples built in her name, those that have felt Hel’s touch often come together and create small communities. Each is overseen by a Matron of Night who receives instructions either directly from Hel herself or an intermediary known as the Shadar-Kai, a group of mysterious beings who are bound to her in Niflheim. 

As the daughter of Loki, many Aesir view Hel skeptically, worried she may follow in her parent’s mutinous footsteps. However, her position as Matron of Death also earns her respect throughout the planes. Her lover Freya, who resides in Asgard, is unable to live with her, as her domain is over the Sun and healing life. To stave off the grief of their separation, Hel and the Loving Mother work together to preserve the balance of life and death, nature and humanity, healing and decay; love and death sometimes working at odds but always twined together.

Hel lives at the border of Niflheim, the lowest plane of existence, as Matron of the Underworld. Hel is both the land of the dead and the name of the deity who rules it. Those who die of sickness, old age, or accident come to her for judgment in her hall Eljudnir. Almost all souls pass to Niflheim, blessed and damned alike. Lost and/or burdened souls may remain in Hel for the remainder of eternity, wandering and displaced but forever protected by the Matron of Death.


### Worshippers

Anyone who fears or reveres death can find solace and purpose in Hel’s cult of followers.

### Depiction

Few existing visual depictions of Hel exist, as her dominion over Niflheim has kept her from walking among the mortals of Midgard. The few illustrations of her portray a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens (her shroud, the Rökkr), with her face obscured by a white porcelain mask and her onyx-black hair straight and never ending.

### Commandments

- Death is the natural end of life. There is no pity for those who have fallen.
- The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully attempt to cast off their destiny must be punished.
- Undeath is an atrocity. Those who would pervert the transition of the soul must be brought down.
