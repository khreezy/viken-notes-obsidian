## The All-Father

### Description

At the top of the tallest building in the highest realm of Asgard, Odin, the All-Father of the world and the gods who inhabit it, sits atop his throne, the Lidskjalf. From his perch he can see the whole world, from frozen Jotunheim to deep underground. Nothing escapes his attention.

Legend says that Odin once traded his left eye for just one sip from the Well of Wisdom, the magic spring that wells up beneath the root where Yggdrasil, the World Tree, hits Jotunheim on Midgard. After drinking from the well, Odin became the wisest of the wise gods, and his remaining all-seeing eye gleamed brighter than ever.

Under Odin’s wisdom, and with his all-seeing might, civilization has flourished. Rulers and warriors alike pay respect at his shrines. With endless knowledge, peace can be maintained, and so order through structure and law guides the will of his devout followers.


### Worshippers. 

Bards, fighters, sorcerers, wizards, philosophers, sages, nobility. All who worship the Pantheon also pay respect to Odin. Offerings to him can be made at any temple in Viken, and even those who have pledged themselves to other deities acknowledge and respect Odin’s power and position as All-Father of the world.

  

### Depiction. 

The All-Father appears as the hulking form of a warrior king. Broad-shouldered and with a thick beard, Odin is most often depicted sitting on his throne, Lidskjalf. His one remaining eye stares directly at whichever being looks upon his image, while the other half of his face is shrouded behind a curtain of hair. Two black ravens perch on his shoulders, and two fierce wolves lay at his feet.

  

### Commandments of Odin

- Suffering is an inevitable consequence of life. But with a strong enough spirit, you can weather any storm. 
- Knowledge is power, and must be protected against those that would use it for evil purposes. Not all that is known should be shared. Guard that knowledge which is powerful. 
- Seek knowledge wherever you can, as everything learned can give you advantage over your foes.
- Men die, cattle die, you yourself must die one day. There is only one thing that will not die: the name, good or bad, that you have made for yourself.
