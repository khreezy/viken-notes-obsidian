## God of Storms and Thunder (he/him)

### Description

Strongest of the Aesir is Odin’s son, Thor, the god of storms and thunder. His temper is as fiery as his red bristling beard; he strikes out before thinking, and his blows are never soft. Thor’s favored weapon is his magic hammer, Mjöllnir, which smashes anything it strikes and will always return to Thor’s hand when summoned.

Nothing invites Thor’s fury like the frost giants and trolls of Jotunheim. The Aesir call on him often to defend Asgard from enemy attacks. Without Thor’s protection, the armies of Surtur and the frost giants of Jotunheim may have already overrun Asgard.

### Worshippers

Barbarians, fighters, paladins, rangers, sailors. The cult of Thor is best known for their raucous and lengthy feasts and festivals. Food and drink are always plentiful in his temples, which are open to any and all who desire to feast, share exploits, and revel with the God of Thunder

### Depiction

Within his temples, Thor is shown as a quintessential warrior, often nude with a beard and long, red hair. As the epitome of muscle and strength, most art depicts Thor in a stance of dominance, perhaps wrestling a terrible beast or raising his hammer, Mjöllnir, above his head. Lightning is present in all of Thor’s symbols.

### Commandments

-  Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice.
-  Strength is the path to greatness, but greatness is the responsible use of strength. Protect those who need protection.
-  The glory of Thor lives through your own glory on the battlefield.
-  Slay the abominations from Jotunheim wherever you find them.
