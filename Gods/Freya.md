## The Loving Mother (she/her)

### Description

Freya’s domain is the Sun, life itself, motherhood and fertility. One of Odin’s daughters, Freya, like all Odin’s children, is as fierce as she is beautiful. She often travels in falcon guise, but it is said she can take the shape of any bird whenever she chooses. When traveling in her standard form, she goes by chariot pulled by two gigantic cats.

As the mother of all things living and life itself, Freya and her followers care deeply about the sanctity of life. Protection of the young, sick, old, and vulnerable are extremely important. Freya strives to uphold balance in all things.

Her lover Hel, who resides in Niflheim, is unable to live with her in Asgard, as her domain is over the moon and death and the underworld itself. To stave off the grief of their separation, Freya and the Goddess of the Underworld work together to preserve the balance of life and death, nature and humanity, healing and decay; love and death sometimes working at odds but always twined together.

### Worshippers

Bards, druids, clerics and healers, sorcerers, lovers, husbands and wives. Freya’s cult preaches protection and love, community and assistance. Her temples double as shelter for weary travelers, safe nights for those without homes, and food enough for all who come knocking.

### Depiction

Those who bring the Loving Mother’s words back to the light unearth her image from ruined temples or create new art to inspire others with her message. Freya is represented as a beautiful, strong woman with dark skin and light hair, rising betwixt a set of angelic ivory wings.

### Commandments

- Lead with mercy, patience, and compassion. Inspire others to unite in fellowship.
- Aid those who are without guidance. Heal those who are without hope.
- Those who are beyond redemption, who revel in slaughter and remorseless evil, must be dispatched with swift justice.
- Your friend’s friends shall be your friends; your friend’s foes shall be your foes. Tread down the path to your friend’s house and don’t let it grow over with weeds.
