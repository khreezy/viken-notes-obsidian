## The Trickster God (he/him/she/her/they/them)

### Description

Loki was not always an Aesir. Once a child of Jotunheim, his graceful nature, handsome figure, and marvelous wit attracted and delighted Odin. Odin was so taken by their bright cleverness that he asked them to join blood and become bound as kin to each other. They would stand by each other, defend each other, and never accept a favor unless it was also offered to the other.

But Loki turned out to be vicious, and spiteful. She loves to play mean tricks. Loki enjoys sowing chaos and trouble, and grows easily bored with the petty squabbles of the other gods. Always seeking out ways to exploit their weaknesses, Loki has worked with the evil gods Surtur and Thrym to undercut the Aesir. 

Loki can take the form of any creature, and disguises himself at every opportunity. It is said that Loki only reveals her true form to mortals after they have pledged their soul in neverending service. With deceptions that range from schoolyard pranks to realm-ending treason, only a fool would underestimate the power and wit of this devious shape-shifter.

### Worshippers

Rogues, assassins, thieves. Worship of Loki has been banned in Úlfurfold. Any follower of Loki’s who is discovered may be imprisoned or put to death, depending on the severity of the crime.

### Depiction

Loki’s true form has never been witnessed by any living mortal. However, it is said that no matter what appearance Loki dons, no matter what race or gender or species they choose to inhabit, their beauty in every form is awe-inspiring. Loki is, afterall, a vain being. Two constants in depictions of Loki are their twisting horns and vibrant green eyes.

As Loki can take on any appearance, race, species, or gender, people of Viken use all different pronouns when referring to this god.

### Commandments

- Seize your own destiny by pursuing your own passions.
- Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole.
- Learn to recognize the weakness in others so you may exploit it for your own benefit.
- Revel in chaos and trickery. Steal, lie, and manipulate whenever you can for your own enrichment.
