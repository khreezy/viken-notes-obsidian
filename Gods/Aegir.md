## The Wrath of the Sea (she/her)

### Description

Aegir’s temples are openly fortified against the works of mortals and against the elements of nature. Townsfolk and travelers can find shelter from tidal waves or flooding in a temple to Aegir, provided they offer the proper respect (and gold). Despite all the offerings, her temples are rarely wealthy. Seeking to emulate the god, they host regular feasts for their communities. The temples contain kitchens, pantries, prayer rooms, and the armories typical of Asgardian temples. Visitors to Aegir’s temples receive a chill welcome. Those planning a sea voyage who make offerings find the clergy can be jolly folks who love food, ale, and jokes as much as anyone. Those who do not make offerings find the clergy menacing. Everyone is welcome on feast day, however.

### Worshippers

Sailors, anyone traveling by sea. Cults of Aegir thrive in seaports. Cultists do not attempt to fit in or to make friends. They teach that those hoping for safe voyages across the sea must appease Aegir. Members of the cults tend to be crews of trading and fishing vessels that sail out of sight of shore. Their membership doesn’t reflect a shared preference for evil, but rather a healthy fear of Aegir.

Aegir’s clergy are few in number and known for their cruelty. Fortunately, they reserve that cruelty for those who fail to properly honor Aegir. Rumors suggest they have burned ships when their captains bragged of sailing the deep sea without first appeasing the stormy goddess.

### Depiction

Surrounded by a twisting maelstrom, depictions of Aegir always highlight this goddess’s fury and mighty wrath. God of sea storms and destroyer of ships, Aegir is a towering figure with long dark hair twisted by the wind. Her eyes are as dark as the clouds that herald an oncoming storm.

### Commandments

- All civilized life is meaningless in the face of the destructive power of nature. Live with this in mind.
- Respect the balance of civilized life and nature. Those who allow themselves to become too weak in civilization deserve no respite in the wilds.
- All who travel the seas must pay offering, or face the chance of disaster. None can profit off the ocean’s bounty without paying back what nature is owed.
