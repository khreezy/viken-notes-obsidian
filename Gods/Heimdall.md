## The All-Seeing (he/him)

### Description

Heimdall is the gatekeeper and guardian of the Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard and Midgard. A capable warrior completely dedicated to Odin, he is perhaps the most important God, for it is his duty to protect Asgard from enemy infiltration.
  
Heimdallâ€™s primary duty is to sound his horn, Gjaller, and alert all the gods to the coming of Ragnarok.

### Worshippers

Fighters, paladins, sentries, guards. The cult of Heimdall appeals to those who find themselves on the edge of their community, facing outward and looking for threats. This attracts fighters of all sorts, as well as nobility and officials who believe in a strong defense. The clergy teaches self-discipline, responsibility, and obedience to authority.

### Depiction

Heimdall is depicted as a dark skinned man. He appears older. Images of him show a man with a longsword in one hand and a curved horn in the other, always prepared to stand his ground or alert the Aesir of incoming danger. His eyes are always open, unblinking in their watch.

### Commandments

- Your duty is to fight the forces of evil, be they giants, devils, demons, undead, or other abominations that threaten the natural order of life. Fight relentlessly and unceasingly for good and order, and punish the wicked and cruel severely.
- You must never turn away a creature in need. Face injustice head-on wherever you encounter it.
- Your word is your bind. Do not stray from it.
