## Lord of Fire (he/him)

### Description

Surtur sits atop the Black Throne in the Wastes of Muspelheim as Master of Tyranny, Vengeance and Desolation. He sends his fiendish servants to bind the souls of mortals to the service of his cruel and devilish power.

Few people openly follow Surtur, and worship of him has been banned throughout Úlfurfold since The Great War. Instead, his cults act in secret, moving leaders toward depravity and tyranny, and away from ideals of a free society. These cults aim to turn entire societies into hotbeds where evil flourishes and countless souls are bound to the Abyss of Muspelheim.

### Worshippers

Fire giants, giants. Surtur rarely grants divine power except to giants. However, a rare few individuals in Midgard have earned his approval. They conceal their devotion to the giant destined to burn down the world.

Worship of Surtur has been banned in Úlfurfold. Any follower of Surtur’s who is discovered may be imprisoned or put to death, depending on the severity of the crime.

### Depiction

When Surtur’s followers picture him, he is either shown mid strike with his mace, or sitting upon the Black Throne of Nessus. He appears as a giant-sized man surrounded in fire, with fire constantly emanating from his nose and eyes. His home is said to be somewhere in the vaste Wastes of Muspelheim.

### Commandments

-  Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of Surtur.
-  Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.
-  As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is for the weak.
- Ruin and raze all the realms to prepare for Ragnarok.
