## The Huntress (she/her)

### Description

Uller, goddess of archery and the hunt, is Thor’s only daughter. Her wife Skadi is the Forge Mother. Uller and her followers are used to the cold, ready and able to survive in the harshest conditions with only their bows and a few arrows.

Uller wields the shortbow Ephyxis, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Uller is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.

### Worshippers

Archers, hunters, rangers, druids, elves, half-elves. Her followers tend to have a closer personal connection with nature, and revere and respect all living things and the sanctity of their lives. It is common for hunters to sacrifice prime cuts of meat after a successful hunt, as thanks to Uller for blessing their kills.

Uller and her followers avoid the sea, as they fear upsetting Njord by entering his domain.

### Depiction

Uller appears elven, with long white hair and piercing eyes and long, angular features. She is depicted always dressed warmly, as her domain is over winter and the frigid cold, usually with her bow, Ephyxis, drawn.

### Commandments

- Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction.
- Trust in yourself above all others. Liberty is paramount, but it cannot come at the cost of others’ freedom.
- Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world. Exist in harmony with it.
