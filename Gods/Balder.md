## The Artist’s Heart (he/him)

### Description

The son of Odin, Balder is the god of beauty, art, and poetry. He is the fairest and gentlest of all the Aesir, and a favorite in Asgard. He inspires artists, poets, and makers of beautiful things. Everyone likes Balder; not even the giants of Jotunheim can speak ill of him.

When Balder began experiencing troubling, ominous dreams, the gods sent Freya down to extract an oath from all things, animate and inanimate, that they would not harm him.

### Worshippers

Bards, gnomes, halflings, artists and poets, farmers and other commoners. Followers of Balder uplift beauty in all things, and take special pride in their ability to craft lovely, comforting joys — baked goods, soft songs, flowery poetry, and delicate crafts overflow from his shrines. Like the god they worship, Balder’s followers love nothing more than an excellent wine.

### Depiction

The fairest of the gods, Balder is most often depicted with lightness in mind: his brow, his eyes, and his hair all shimmering with the softest golden light. Beautiful wild flowers are braided into his long hair, and a gentle smile always pulls at his lips.

### Commandments

- Create, inspire, and find beauty in all that you do. Creation of beautiful things is as close to godliness as mortals can achieve.
- Combat sorrow, anger, and pain with kindness whenever you can.
- Out of great tragedy comes new growth, new opportunity, and new hope for the future. Fate cannot be avoided, only accepted with a laugh and a smile.
