[Fraeyda](posts/PCs/Fraeyda.md) was wadnering the streets and found a long streak of mud

investigated it and found:

a putrid smell

twoish feet wide and stretches 10-15 feet down part of the road into a storm drain

couldn't see anything down the drain

apparently silvered weapons are not allowed in the [Kingdom of Úlfurfold](posts/Places/Kingdom%20of%20%C3%9Alfurfold.md)
