### Notes

- Horizon Walker who guards the roots of [Yggdrasil](content/Places/Yggdrasil.md)
- Encountered when the [Four Toes](content/PCs/Four%20Toes.md) found themselves on [Yggdrasil](content/Places/Yggdrasil.md) to try to find [Eir](content/PCs/Eir.md)
- Lacks memory
- We once encountered a [Mind Flayer](content/Species/Mind%20Flayer.md) whose tentacles embraced her head and it apparently felt "familiar"
