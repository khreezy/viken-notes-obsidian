### Notes

- Horizon Walker who guards the roots of [Yggdrasil](posts/Places/Yggdrasil.md)
- Encountered when the [Four Toes](posts/PCs/Four%20Toes.md) found themselves on [Yggdrasil](posts/Places/Yggdrasil.md) to try to find [Eir](posts/PCs/Eir.md)
- Lacks memory
- We once encountered a [Mind Flayer](posts/Species/Mind%20Flayer.md) whose tentacles embraced her head and it apparently felt "familiar"
