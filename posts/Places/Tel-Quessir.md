# Description

The Elvish city of Tel-Quessir lies  
deep in the heart of the [Savalier Woods](posts/Places/Savalier%20Woods.md). The  
elves have made their homes in the trees of the  
woods, carving homes inside the trunks which  
magically continue to live and grow, even when  
hollowed out. Homes high off the ground  
connected by rope bridges, with magic torches  
that cast a low light throughout the city, always  
giving the appearance of twilight. The ruler of  
Tel-Quessir is Queen [Keyleth Siannodel](posts/NPCs/Keyleth%20Siannodel.md).

### Notes
