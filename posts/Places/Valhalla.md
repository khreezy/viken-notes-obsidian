Valhalla is [Odin](content/Gods/Odin.md)’s vast hall in [Asgard](content/Places/Asgard.md). It is home to all those slain in battle. Every day the rooster [Gullinkambi](content/NPCs/Gullinkambi.md) (“Golden Comb”) wakes the fallen soldiers, and they venture out to fight each other in training for [Ragnarok](content/Events/Ragnarok.md), the final battle. Every evening those killed in the battle rise, whole and healed, to feast and be merry, until the next morning when their battle rages again.
