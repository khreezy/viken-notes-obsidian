The lowest of the three worlds in Asgardian cosmology, Niflheim is home to [Hel](posts/Gods/Hel.md). [Hel](posts/Gods/Hel.md) is both the land of the dead and the name of the deity who rules it, and [Hel](posts/Gods/Hel.md) can be found right at the border where Niflheim touches the [Midgard](posts/Places/Midgard.md). Those who die of sickness, old age, or accident come to Niflheim for judgment by Hel in her hall Eljudnir.
