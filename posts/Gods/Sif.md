## The Honor-Bound (she/her)

### Description

Wife to Thor and mother to Uller, Sif the Honor-Bound is a fierce golden-haired goddess of battle. One of Odin’s famed Valkyries, Sif is a general of Asgard’s armies and a commanding presence to gods and mortals alike.

Sif teaches honor in everything. Commitment to a cause, loyalty to a people, honor in combat (even against one’s worst enemies), and the importance of found family and the sisterhood formed in battle. Female warriors are particularly attracted to her teachings, and many of the bravest fighters hope to one day be welcomed into her army of Valkyries.

### Worshippers

Barbarians, fighters, paladins, rangers, combat instructors. Sif, a general in Asgard’s armies, rewards bravery and cunning in combat. Most of her followers are women, fierce and capable warriors who command armies and vanquish foes. Her followers teach the benefits of preparedness, courage, and loyalty. They forge deep bonds within their sisterhood. Any follower of Sif will always answer another follower’s call for help or assistance. To deny one’s sister help when she needs it most is the highest crime in this clergy.

### Depiction

Sif has seen many terrible battles, and depictions of her reflect this. Strong bodied and serious, Sif grips her sword in her hand, always prepared for battle. Her scarred face might not appear beautiful at first glance, but her determined expression and battle-worn armor evoke awe and admiration in all who look upon her.
 
### Commandments

- Remain stoic and tenacious in the face of catastrophe.
- Uphold and promote loyalty to your family, loyalty to your clan, and loyalty to your sisters.
- Battles must be conducted with honor. To use cheap tricks, or to deny one's enemy mercy, is to fight as the fiends of the lower planes do.
