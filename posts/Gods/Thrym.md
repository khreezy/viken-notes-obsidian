## The King of Frost (he/him)

### Description

Thrym makes his home in the Frozen North of Jotunheim. He stalks across Jotunheim, protecting his lands from the interference of the Aesir and occasionally sending his own forces of destruction to attack Midgard.

As no mortal has ever entered Jotunheim and lived to tell about it, no one knows where his palace resides. Thrym is unable to cross the Bifrost without being burned, and he resents the isolation forced upon him by the higher gods who look down upon him and his homeland. It is said that Thrym travels atop an ancient white dragon, circling the skies and the Desolate Straits around his home and destroying any agent of the Aesir who attempts to enter his land. He particularly detests Thor.

### Worshippers

Frost Giants, giants. Thrym rarely grants divine power except to giants. A few cults of Thrym thrive in Midgard. These cults teach that the world will end in the Fimbul Winter, and that cold will triumph after Surtur’s fire burns the world. Members of Thrym’s cult seek every opportunity to undermine Thor’s followers. Though Surtur has a similar cult of worshippers, fire and ice never mix.

### Depiction

The descendant of Frost Giants, Thrym is a towering figure with a wild, unkempt beard and piled high with thick furs from the beasts he has killed himself.

### Commandments

- Ruin. Conquer. Kill.
- The weak exist to be crushed by the strong. Be the strong.
- There are no emotions but fury and joy. The rest are weakness.
- Seek out and destroy the followers of Thor wherever they may be.
