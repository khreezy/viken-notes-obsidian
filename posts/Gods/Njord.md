## The Restless (he/him)

### Description

Once the husband of Skadi, since his marriage ended Njord has mostly withdrawn to Asgard. But Njord’s blessings and displeasure are widely felt, particularly by those who make their lives near or on the sea. Njord, as a restless wanderer himself, is an appealing deity for travelers, rangers, and daring explorers.

Njord’s temples are sturdy structures meant to withstand the trials of coastal weather. They generally sit right on the water and have their own docks. Most temples have storage for sail canvas, ropes, tar, paint, and other boating supplies. Visitors to Njord’s temples find the fare plain but filling. Clergy and faithful draw owners of seagoing vessels into conversation. Strangers are largely ignored unless they bring information about shoals, currents, weather, or other conditions hazardous to ships.

### Worshippers

Sailors, fishermen, and those who rely on the sea for a living count themselves among Njord’s most devout worshippers. Most display weathering and scars from lives spent in, on, and around the water. Altars to Njord can be found in every major fishing city/village, and scattered shrines abound near the ocean and rivers. Fishermen will often leave their largest fish at Njord’s altars as a sign of thanks for a plentiful bounty.

### Depiction

An older god, Njord is always depicted with watery imagery. Frequently shown bursting from the waves themselves and wielding his gleaming trident, Njord’s beard and hair are wild with the wind and sea spray. Strong like his followers, Njord’s gaze often extends over the water, calling to wandering adventurers and inspiring courage and the love of exploration.

### Commandments

- To sit still is to begin to die, to move is to live. Do not get comfortable in stillness, instead chase glory wherever it may be found.
- Growth in one’s own abilities is the path to glory. Those who would let their abilities wither are undeserving of notice.
- All can obtain glory. Some may be especially gifted, and others may find barriers in their path, but none should be told their futures cannot be glorious. Encourage those who have lost hope in their strength.
