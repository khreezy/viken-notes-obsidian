Townsfolk and travelers can find shelter from tidal waves or flooding in a temple to Aegir, provided they offer the proper respect (and gold). Despite all the offerings, her temples are rarely wealthy. Seeking to emulate the god, they host regular feasts for their communities. The temples contain kitchens, pantries, prayer rooms, and the armories typical of Asgardian temples. Visitors to Aegir’s temples receive a chill welcome. Those planning a sea voyage who make offerings find the clergy can be jolly folks who love food, ale, and jokes as much as anyone. Those who do not make offerings find the clergy menacing. Everyone is welcome on feast day, however.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nSailors, anyone traveling by sea. Cults of Aegir thrive in seaports. Cultists do not attempt to fit in or to make friends. They teach that those hoping for safe voyages across the sea must appease Aegir. Members of the cults tend to be crews of trading and fishing vessels that sail out of sight of shore. Their membership doesn’t reflect a shared preference for evil, but rather a healthy fear of Aegir.\n\nAegir’s clergy are few in number and known for their cruelty. Fortunately, they reserve that cruelty for those who fail to properly honor Aegir. Rumors suggest they have burned ships when their captains bragged of sailing the deep sea without first appeasing the stormy goddess.\n\n### Depiction\n\nSurrounded by a twisting maelstrom, depictions of Aegir always highlight this goddess’s fury and mighty wrath. God of sea storms and destroyer of ships, Aegir is a towering figure with long dark hair twisted by the wind. Her eyes are as dark as the clouds that herald an oncoming storm.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- All civilized life is meaningless in the face of the destructive power of nature. Live with this in mind.\n- Respect the balance of civilized life and nature. Those who allow themselves to become too weak in civilization deserve no respite in the wilds.\n- All who travel the seas must pay offering, or face the chance of disaster. None can profit off the ocean’s bounty without paying back what nature is owed.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Balder":{"title":"Balder","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Neutral-Good | Beauty, poetry and literature, artists and scholars, flora and fauna | Arcana, Knowledge, Life, Light, Peace, Nature | Wreath of grass and grain affixed to a crook |\n\n## The Artist’s Heart (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nThe son of Odin, Balder is the god of beauty, art, and poetry. He is the fairest and gentlest of all the Aesir, and a favorite in Asgard. He inspires artists, poets, and makers of beautiful things. Everyone likes Balder; not even the giants of Jotunheim can speak ill of him.\n\nWhen Balder began experiencing troubling, ominous dreams, the gods sent Freya down to extract an oath from all things, animate and inanimate, that they would not harm him.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nBards, gnomes, halflings, artists and poets, farmers and other commoners. Followers of Balder uplift beauty in all things, and take special pride in their ability to craft lovely, comforting joys — baked goods, soft songs, flowery poetry, and delicate crafts overflow from his shrines. Like the god they worship, Balder’s followers love nothing more than an excellent wine.\n\n### Depiction\n\nThe fairest of the gods, Balder is most often depicted with lightness in mind: his brow, his eyes, and his hair all shimmering with the softest golden light. Beautiful wild flowers are braided into his long hair, and a gentle smile always pulls at his lips.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Create, inspire, and find beauty in all that you do. Creation of beautiful things is as close to godliness as mortals can achieve.\n- Combat sorrow, anger, and pain with kindness whenever you can.\n- Out of great tragedy comes new growth, new opportunity, and new hope for the future. Fate cannot be avoided, only accepted with a laugh and a smile.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Divinity-in-Viken":{"title":"Divinity in Viken","content":"\n[Viken](Viken.md)’s people have been steeped in war, conflict, and struggles for survival since the continent’s founding. Divinity is very important to the people of [Viken](Viken.md). A tight pantheon of related deities keep watch over the continent, interfering in affairs fairly regularly, particularly in periods of great strife.\n\n  \n\nThe War of 500 P.D., a continent-spanning battle that threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the world itself, happened within living memory of many of the older members of society. The Gods’ intervention in that epic battle is the only thing that kept the armies of Surtur from wiping out civilization. Many in Úlfurfold believed this battle was Ragnarok, the prophesied Final Battle that will destroy the world. The defeat of Surtur’s armies led to weeks-long celebrations throughout the continent, as the survivors rejoiced in their victory and devoted excessive worship to the gods who saved them.\n\nTemples to the gods are plentiful in [Viken](Viken.md). Shrines have been set up along many of the major roadways for people to pay homage to their gods and leave offerings of food, precious silks, gold, or other tributes. Port cities and towns full of sailors will likely worship Njord, god of the sea and winds, while the Dwarvish City of Faerun worships Skadi, the goddess of the forge and craftsmanship. Those who seek glory in battle worship Thor, god of storms and thunder, or his wife Sif, goddess of honor. Elves who live in the kingdom of Úlfurfold might worship Uller, goddess of the hunt.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Forseti":{"title":"Forseti","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Neutral | God of justice, peacemaker | Arcana, Knowledge, Order, Protection | A bearded man with covered eyes, blind |\n\n## The Peacemaker (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nForseti, son of Balder, has never told a lie. The gods call on Forseti to be impartial in all things. Thus, he is the God of Justice, and acts as Chief Justice of the Aesir. Forseti is an even-tempered god, but is easily enraged when confronted with injustice and chaos. While not nearly as beautiful as his father, Forseti’s wisdom and judgment are unparalleled.\n\nForseti’s followers are devoted to justice over everything, including their own god. They trust in their own judgment as sacrosanct. Level-headedness is one of Forseti’s founding principles, and he teaches all who care to learn about the benefits of impartiality and decisiveness.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nPaladins, judges, halflings, all those who seek knowledge in the name of peace and fairness. Forseti’s clergy believe in justice, though they respect Asgardian traditions of revenge. They often act as judges, intermediaries, and arbitrators for their communities. The clergy are quick to protect those involved in disputes, insisting that no one is guilty without a fair trial.\n\nForseti’s temples resemble courtrooms and often serve as the same. They contain small rooms for legal discussions and settlements, libraries of local laws, and armories. Visitors to Forseti’s temples find them quieter and more restrained than other Asgardian temples, particularly if court is in session. Those seeking assistance in resolving a dispute can request a private conference with at least one member of the clergy/\n\nForseti’s cult believes that ethics and morality originate from the lawmakers and rulers. True justice can only come from staying impartial. His worshipers teach the value of judges and arbitrators to society, and seek to develop the same unbiased sense of justice through Forseti’s teachings.\n\n### Depiction\n\nForseti is not nearly as beautiful as his father, but his calm nature and level-headed wisdom make him an appealing god all the same. Well-trimmed hair and beard, as well as simple but clean clothing are present in images of him. Many images depict him sitting in solemn judgment, his expression always neutral and attentive. Depictions show Forseti’s eyes always covered, representing the blind and impartial nature of justice.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Ethics and morality originate from lawmakers and rulers. It is not your place to write the laws of the world, only to carry out their orders.\n- True power comes from knowledge. Seek to learn all you can so you may be a better arbiter of truth and justice.\n- True justice can only come from staying impartial.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Freya":{"title":"Freya","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Neutral-Good | Life, the Sun, fertility, healing, family, motherhood | Life, Light, Nature, Peace | A falcon taking flight |\n\n## The Loving Mother (she/her)\n\n### Description\n\nFreya’s domain is the Sun, life itself, motherhood and fertility. One of Odin’s daughters, Freya, like all Odin’s children, is as fierce as she is beautiful. She often travels in falcon guise, but it is said she can take the shape of any bird whenever she chooses. When traveling in her standard form, she goes by chariot pulled by two gigantic cats.\n\nAs the mother of all things living and life itself, Freya and her followers care deeply about the sanctity of life. Protection of the young, sick, old, and vulnerable are extremely important. Freya strives to uphold balance in all things.\n\nHer lover Hel, who resides in Niflheim, is unable to live with her in Asgard, as her domain is over the moon and death and the underworld itself. To stave off the grief of their separation, Freya and the Goddess of the Underworld work together to preserve the balance of life and death, nature and humanity, healing and decay; love and death sometimes working at odds but always twined together.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nBards, druids, clerics and healers, sorcerers, lovers, husbands and wives. Freya’s cult preaches protection and love, community and assistance. Her temples double as shelter for weary travelers, safe nights for those without homes, and food enough for all who come knocking.\n\n### Depiction\n\nThose who bring the Loving Mother’s words back to the light unearth her image from ruined temples or create new art to inspire others with her message. Freya is represented as a beautiful, strong woman with dark skin and light hair, rising betwixt a set of angelic ivory wings.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Lead with mercy, patience, and compassion. Inspire others to unite in fellowship.\n- Aid those who are without guidance. Heal those who are without hope.\n- Those who are beyond redemption, who revel in slaughter and remorseless evil, must be dispatched with swift justice.\n- Your friend’s friends shall be your friends; your friend’s foes shall be your foes.

A capable warrior completely dedicated to Odin, he is perhaps the most important God, for it is his duty to protect Asgard from enemy infiltration.\n  \nHeimdall’s primary duty is to sound his horn, Gjaller, and alert all the gods to the coming of Ragnarok.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nFighters, paladins, sentries, guards. The cult of Heimdall appeals to those who find themselves on the edge of their community, facing outward and looking for threats. This attracts fighters of all sorts, as well as nobility and officials who believe in a strong defense. The clergy teaches self-discipline, responsibility, and obedience to authority.\n\n### Depiction\n\nHeimdall is depicted as a dark skinned man. He appears older. Images of him show a man with a longsword in one hand and a curved horn in the other, always prepared to stand his ground or alert the Aesir of incoming danger. His eyes are always open, unblinking in their watch.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Your duty is to fight the forces of evil, be they giants, devils, demons, undead, or other abominations that threaten the natural order of life. Fight relentlessly and unceasingly for good and order, and punish the wicked and cruel severely.\n- You must never turn away a creature in need.

Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the border between life and death and ensuring the natural transition is undefiled. Many funerals ask her blessing to protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath.\n\nWhile she has no grand temples built in her name, those that have felt Hel’s touch often come together and create small communities. Each is overseen by a Matron of Night who receives instructions either directly from Hel herself or an intermediary known as the [Shadar-Kai](Shadar-Kai), a group of mysterious beings who are bound to her in [Niflheim](content/Places/Niflheim.md). \n\nAs the daughter of [Loki](content/Gods/Loki.md), many [Aesir](content/Organizations/Aesir.md) view Hel skeptically, worried she may follow in her parent’s mutinous footsteps. However, her position as Matron of Death also earns her respect throughout the planes. Her lover Freya, who resides in Asgard, is unable to live with her, as her domain is over the Sun and healing life. To stave off the grief of their separation, Hel and the Loving Mother work together to preserve the balance of life and death, nature and humanity, healing and decay; love and death sometimes working at odds but always twined together.\n\nHel lives at the border of [Niflheim](content/Places/Niflheim.md), the lowest plane of existence, as Matron of the Underworld. Hel is both the land of the dead and the name of the deity who rules it. Those who die of sickness, old age, or accident come to her for judgment in her hall Eljudnir. Almost all souls pass to [Niflheim](content/Places/Niflheim.md), blessed and damned alike. Lost and/or burdened souls may remain in Hel for the remainder of eternity, wandering and displaced but forever protected by the Matron of Death.\n\n\n### Worshippers\n\nAnyone who fears or reveres death can find solace and purpose in Hel’s cult of followers.\n\n### Depiction\n\nFew existing visual depictions of Hel exist, as her dominion over Niflheim has kept her from walking among the mortals of Midgard. The few illustrations of her portray a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens (her shroud, the [Rökkr](R%C3%B6kkr)), with her face obscured by a white porcelain mask and her onyx-black hair straight and never ending.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Death is the natural end of life. There is no pity for those who have fallen.\n- The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully attempt to cast off their destiny must be punished.\n- Undeath is an atrocity. Those who would pervert the transition of the soul must be brought down.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Hermod":{"title":"Hermod","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Chaotic-Neutral | God of luck | Arcana, Knowledge, Trickery| A coin flipping through the air |\n\n## The Lucky (they/them)\n\n### Description\n\nHermod, the messenger god, is  another god of luck and trickery. They have spent most of their life playing second-fiddle to the notorious god Loki. Loki’s betrayal and subsequent fall from grace has not coincided with an increased interest in Hermod’s teachings — if anything, the opposite is true. Mistrust abounds towards Hermod and their (rather limited) band of followers, but the god of luck doesn’t care. They revel in the unknown, the downtrodden, the lucky and unlucky in equal measure. Hermod doesn’t care about their followers’ professions, backgrounds, or alignment. Like all good messengers, they fulfill their duty quickly and without questioning motives or passing judgment.\n\nHermod hasn’t been known to bless many of their followers; as a god of luck and trickery, it takes quite an extraordinary person to impress this deity. They reward audacity, confidence, and the chaotic boldness of those who seek out pleasure above all else.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nBards, rogues, messengers, heralds, travelers. With few followers and even fewer devout worshippers, shrines and temples dedicated to Hermod are rare and scattered, usually long-since abandoned. Followers of Hermod shirk standard worship practices, instead usually offering worship through intensely clever ticks or daring, nearly-impossible audacious feats.\n\n### Depiction\n\nHermod is most often depicted as a tan-skinned androgynous figure. Alternating between masculine and feminine dress, Hermod’s sharp eyes and sharp smile are the only thing consistent in how this deity is drawn.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Luck favors the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, and to do so is to have Hermod behind you.\n- Let the shadows protect you from the burning light of fanatical good and the absolute darkness of evil.\n- Walk unbridled and untethered, forging new memories and experiences with every forward step.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Loki":{"title":"Loki","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Chaotic-Evil | Trickery, thieves, wittiness | Knowledge, Trickery | A grinning white mask topped with curved horns |\n\n## The Trickster God (he/him/she/her/they/them)\n\n### Description\n\nLoki was not always an Aesir. Once a child of Jotunheim, his graceful nature, handsome figure, and marvelous wit attracted and delighted Odin. Odin was so taken by their bright cleverness that he asked them to join blood and become bound as kin to each other. They would stand by each other, defend each other, and never accept a favor unless it was also offered to the other.\n\nBut Loki turned out to be vicious, and spiteful. She loves to play mean tricks. Loki enjoys sowing chaos and trouble, and grows easily bored with the petty squabbles of the other gods. Always seeking out ways to exploit their weaknesses, Loki has worked with the evil gods Surtur and Thrym to undercut the Aesir. \n\nLoki can take the form of any creature, and disguises himself at every opportunity. It is said that Loki only reveals her true form to mortals after they have pledged their soul in neverending service. With deceptions that range from schoolyard pranks to realm-ending treason, only a fool would underestimate the power and wit of this devious shape-shifter.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nRogues, assassins, thieves. Worship of Loki has been banned in Úlfurfold. Any follower of Loki’s who is discovered may be imprisoned or put to death, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\n### Depiction\n\nLoki’s true form has never been witnessed by any living mortal. However, it is said that no matter what appearance Loki dons, no matter what race or gender or species they choose to inhabit, their beauty in every form is awe-inspiring. Loki is, afterall, a vain being. Two constants in depictions of Loki are their twisting horns and vibrant green eyes.\n\nAs Loki can take on any appearance, race, species, or gender, people of Viken use all different pronouns when referring to this god.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Seize your own destiny by pursuing your own passions.\n- Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole.\n- Learn to recognize the weakness in others so you may exploit it for your own benefit.\n- Revel in chaos and trickery. Steal, lie, and manipulate whenever you can for your own enrichment.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Njord":{"title":"Njord","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Neutral-Good | God of sea and wind | Nature, Tempest, War | An old man with a worn traveler’s cloak taking shelter from a storm |\n\n## The Restless (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nOnce the husband of Skadi, since his marriage ended Njord has mostly withdrawn to Asgard. But Njord’s blessings and displeasure are widely felt, particularly by those who make their lives near or on the sea. Njord, as a restless wanderer himself, is an appealing deity for travelers, rangers, and daring explorers.\n\nNjord’s temples are sturdy structures meant to withstand the trials of coastal weather. They generally sit right on the water and have their own docks. Most temples have storage for sail canvas, ropes, tar, paint, and other boating supplies. Visitors to Njord’s temples find the fare plain but filling. Clergy and faithful draw owners of seagoing vessels into conversation. Strangers are largely ignored unless they bring information about shoals, currents, weather, or other conditions hazardous to ships.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nSailors, fishermen, and those who rely on the sea for a living count themselves among Njord’s most devout worshippers. Most display weathering and scars from lives spent in, on, and around the water. Altars to Njord can be found in every major fishing city/village, and scattered shrines abound near the ocean and rivers. Fishermen will often leave their largest fish at Njord’s altars as a sign of thanks for a plentiful bounty.\n\n### Depiction\n\nAn older god, Njord is always depicted with watery imagery. Frequently shown bursting from the waves themselves and wielding his gleaming trident, Njord’s beard and hair are wild with the wind and sea spray. Strong like his followers, Njord’s gaze often extends over the water, calling to wandering adventurers and inspiring courage and the love of exploration.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- To sit still is to begin to die, to move is to live. Do not get comfortable in stillness, instead chase glory wherever it may be found.\n- Growth in one’s own abilities is the path to glory. Those who would let their abilities wither are undeserving of notice.\n- All can obtain glory. Some may be especially gifted, and others may find barriers in their path, but none should be told their futures cannot be glorious. Encourage those who have lost hope in their strength.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Odin":{"title":"Odin","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Lawful-Good | Civilization, order, law, justice, and peace | Knowledge, Order | A simple axe inlaid with gold scales |\n\n## The All-Father\n\n### Description\n\nAt the top of the tallest building in the highest realm of Asgard, Odin, the All-Father of the world and the gods who inhabit it, sits atop his throne, the Lidskjalf. From his perch he can see the whole world, from frozen Jotunheim to deep underground. Nothing escapes his attention.\n\nLegend says that Odin once traded his left eye for just one sip from the Well of Wisdom, the magic spring that wells up beneath the root where Yggdrasil, the World Tree, hits Jotunheim on Midgard. After drinking from the well, Odin became the wisest of the wise gods, and his remaining all-seeing eye gleamed brighter than ever.\n\nUnder Odin’s wisdom, and with his all-seeing might, civilization has flourished. Rulers and warriors alike pay respect at his shrines. With endless knowledge, peace can be maintained, and so order through structure and law guides the will of his devout followers.\n\n\n### Worshippers. \n\nBards, fighters, sorcerers, wizards, philosophers, sages, nobility. All who worship the Pantheon also pay respect to Odin. Offerings to him can be made at any temple in Viken, and even those who have pledged themselves to other deities acknowledge and respect Odin’s power and position as All-Father of the world.\n\n  \n\n### Depiction. \n\nThe All-Father appears as the hulking form of a warrior king. Broad-shouldered and with a thick beard, Odin is most often depicted sitting on his throne, Lidskjalf. His one remaining eye stares directly at whichever being looks upon his image, while the other half of his face is shrouded behind a curtain of hair. Two black ravens perch on his shoulders, and two fierce wolves lay at his feet.\n\n  \n\n### Commandments of Odin\n\n- Suffering is an inevitable consequence of life. But with a strong enough spirit, you can weather any storm. \n- Knowledge is power, and must be protected against those that would use it for evil purposes. Not all that is known should be shared. Guard that knowledge which is powerful. \n- Seek knowledge wherever you can, as everything learned can give you advantage over your foes.\n- Men die, cattle die, you yourself must die one day.

One of Odin’s famed Valkyries, Sif is a general of Asgard’s armies and a commanding presence to gods and mortals alike.\n\nSif teaches honor in everything. Commitment to a cause, loyalty to a people, honor in combat (even against one’s worst enemies), and the importance of found family and the sisterhood formed in battle. Female warriors are particularly attracted to her teachings, and many of the bravest fighters hope to one day be welcomed into her army of Valkyries.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nBarbarians, fighters, paladins, rangers, combat instructors. Sif, a general in Asgard’s armies, rewards bravery and cunning in combat. Most of her followers are women, fierce and capable warriors who command armies and vanquish foes. Her followers teach the benefits of preparedness, courage, and loyalty. They forge deep bonds within their sisterhood. Any follower of Sif will always answer another follower’s call for help or assistance. To deny one’s sister help when she needs it most is the highest crime in this clergy.\n\n### Depiction\n\nSif has seen many terrible battles, and depictions of her reflect this. Strong bodied and serious, Sif grips her sword in her hand, always prepared for battle. Her scarred face might not appear beautiful at first glance, but her determined expression and battle-worn armor evoke awe and admiration in all who look upon her.\n \n### Commandments\n\n- Remain stoic and tenacious in the face of catastrophe.\n- Uphold and promote loyalty to your family, loyalty to your clan, and loyalty to your sisters.\n- Battles must be conducted with honor. To use cheap tricks, or to deny one's enemy mercy, is to fight as the fiends of the lower planes do.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Skadi":{"title":"Skadi","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Lawful-Neutral | Earth and mountains, craftsmanship, beauty, the forge | Forge, Knowledge, Nature, Order | A gem-encrusted forging hammer |\n\n## Mother of the Forge (she/her)\n\n### Description\n\nSkadi is a female giant whose father Sleipnir built the great walls protecting Asgard. As the only creature with knowledge of Asgard’s defenses, upon completion of the project, Thor killed him.\n\nSkadi came to Asgard seeking revenge against Thor for killing her father. When she arrived at Asgard in her hand-crafted armor she so impressed the gods that they offered her her pick of the bachelor gods if she would not go to war against them. The only condition was that she could only see their feet when she made her choice. Thinking the cleanest, whitest feet must belong to Balder, the kindest and gentlest god, she made her choice only to discover they belonged to the older god Njord, whose feet the sea washed clean every day. They married, but Njord and Skadi were an ill-matched pair. He loved the seashore, and she loved the mountains. Because they couldn’t agree on a place to live, Njord and Skadi moved back and forth between the mountains of Midgard and the seas of Asgard. Their marriage did not last long, and Skadi divorced him and married Uller, goddess of winter and the hunt.\n\nAs the Mother of the Forge, Skadi’s domain is over earth and the mountains and all things made from it. Her followers devote themselves to the making of fine armor and weaponry, as Skadi and her worshippers believe one must always be ready for battle. But preparedness doesn’t mean you must eschew beauty and luxury.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nDwarves, druids, craftspeople and smiths. Though most of Skadi’s followers are skilled warriors, they rarely enter combat unless absolutely necessary. Temples to her are found in the mountains, and are always built from local materials and blend into the landscape.\n\n### Depiction\n\nDepictions of Skadi vary from city to city, but a few features are universal. A descendant of giants, she is always drawn as a large and imposing figure, with wild, dark hair, usually with her forging hammer raised, poised to strike. Any depiction of her originating with the dwarves of Faerun also shows Skadi with a full, intricately-braided beard. All dwarves, regardless of sex, take extraordinary pride in their beards, with fullness often indicating success on the battlefield. Skadi’s beard in their artwork is incomparably impressive.\n\nThe dwarves of Viken are particularly devout followers of Skadi, and it is said that the entire mountain city of Faerun is one large temple to Skadi.\n\n### Commandments\n\n-   Respect for the community and the clan must balance with a respect for nature and its unpredictability. \n-   Keep your allies close. The community is always stronger than the individual.\n-   The most beautiful things in the world come from what we forge with our own hands. Learn what skills you possess so that you may better enrich the world around you.\n-   Always be prepared for battle, for the best defense is a good offense.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Surtur":{"title":"Surtur","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Lawful-Evil | Fire giants and war, strength of arms, ends justify the means, exploitation | Death, War | A crown of wicked black thorns, dripping blood |\n\n## Lord of Fire (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nSurtur sits atop the Black Throne in the Wastes of Muspelheim as Master of Tyranny, Vengeance and Desolation. He sends his fiendish servants to bind the souls of mortals to the service of his cruel and devilish power.\n\nFew people openly follow Surtur, and worship of him has been banned throughout Úlfurfold since The Great War. Instead, his cults act in secret, moving leaders toward depravity and tyranny, and away from ideals of a free society. These cults aim to turn entire societies into hotbeds where evil flourishes and countless souls are bound to the Abyss of Muspelheim.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nFire giants, giants. Surtur rarely grants divine power except to giants. However, a rare few individuals in Midgard have earned his approval. They conceal their devotion to the giant destined to burn down the world.\n\nWorship of Surtur has been banned in Úlfurfold. Any follower of Surtur’s who is discovered may be imprisoned or put to death, depending on the severity of the crime.\n\n### Depiction\n\nWhen Surtur’s followers picture him, he is either shown mid strike with his mace, or sitting upon the Black Throne of Nessus. He appears as a giant-sized man surrounded in fire, with fire constantly emanating from his nose and eyes. His home is said to be somewhere in the vaste Wastes of Muspelheim.\n\n### Commandments\n\n-  Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of Surtur.\n-  Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.\n-  As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is for the weak.\n- Ruin and raze all the realms to prepare for Ragnarok.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Thor":{"title":"Thor","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Chaotic-Good | Storms and thunder, courage, glory in battle, competition | Strength, Tempest, Nature, War | A hammer over crossed lightning bolts |\n\n## God of Storms and Thunder (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nStrongest of the Aesir is Odin’s son, Thor, the god of storms and thunder. His temper is as fiery as his red bristling beard; he strikes out before thinking, and his blows are never soft. Thor’s favored weapon is his magic hammer, Mjöllnir, which smashes anything it strikes and will always return to Thor’s hand when summoned.\n\nNothing invites Thor’s fury like the frost giants and trolls of Jotunheim. The Aesir call on him often to defend Asgard from enemy attacks. Without Thor’s protection, the armies of Surtur and the frost giants of Jotunheim may have already overrun Asgard.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nBarbarians, fighters, paladins, rangers, sailors. The cult of Thor is best known for their raucous and lengthy feasts and festivals. Food and drink are always plentiful in his temples, which are open to any and all who desire to feast, share exploits, and revel with the God of Thunder\n\n### Depiction\n\nWithin his temples, Thor is shown as a quintessential warrior, often nude with a beard and long, red hair. As the epitome of muscle and strength, most art depicts Thor in a stance of dominance, perhaps wrestling a terrible beast or raising his hammer, Mjöllnir, above his head. Lightning is present in all of Thor’s symbols.\n\n### Commandments\n\n-  Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice.\n-  Strength is the path to greatness, but greatness is the responsible use of strength. Protect those who need protection.\n-  The glory of Thor lives through your own glory on the battlefield.\n-  Slay the abominations from Jotunheim wherever you find them.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Thrym":{"title":"Thrym","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Chaotic-Evil | God of frost giants and cold | Death, Nature, Tempest, War | White double-bladed axe coated in frost |\n\n## The King of Frost (he/him)\n\n### Description\n\nThrym makes his home in the Frozen North of Jotunheim. He stalks across Jotunheim, protecting his lands from the interference of the Aesir and occasionally sending his own forces of destruction to attack Midgard.\n\nAs no mortal has ever entered Jotunheim and lived to tell about it, no one knows where his palace resides. Thrym is unable to cross the Bifrost without being burned, and he resents the isolation forced upon him by the higher gods who look down upon him and his homeland. It is said that Thrym travels atop an ancient white dragon, circling the skies and the Desolate Straits around his home and destroying any agent of the Aesir who attempts to enter his land. He particularly detests Thor.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nFrost Giants, giants. Thrym rarely grants divine power except to giants. A few cults of Thrym thrive in Midgard. These cults teach that the world will end in the Fimbul Winter, and that cold will triumph after Surtur’s fire burns the world. Members of Thrym’s cult seek every opportunity to undermine Thor’s followers. Though Surtur has a similar cult of worshippers, fire and ice never mix.\n\n### Depiction\n\nThe descendant of Frost Giants, Thrym is a towering figure with a wild, unkempt beard and piled high with thick furs from the beasts he has killed himself.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Ruin. Conquer. Kill.\n- The weak exist to be crushed by the strong. Be the strong.\n- There are no emotions but fury and joy. The rest are weakness.\n- Seek out and destroy the followers of Thor wherever they may be.","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.552060705Z","tags":null},"/Gods/Uller":{"title":"Uller","content":"\n| Alignment | Province |  Suggested Domains | Common Symbology |\n| ----------| ---------| -------------------| -----------------|\n| Chaotic-Neutral | Goddess of hunting and winter | Life, Nature | A drawn longbow knocked with an arrow |\n\n## The Huntress (she/her)\n\n### Description\n\nUller, goddess of archery and the hunt, is Thor’s only daughter. Her wife Skadi is the Forge Mother. Uller and her followers are used to the cold, ready and able to survive in the harshest conditions with only their bows and a few arrows.\n\nUller wields the shortbow Ephyxis, the bow whose arrows herald the turning of the seasons. Uller is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant.\n\n### Worshippers\n\nArchers, hunters, rangers, druids, elves, half-elves. Her followers tend to have a closer personal connection with nature, and revere and respect all living things and the sanctity of their lives. It is common for hunters to sacrifice prime cuts of meat after a successful hunt, as thanks to Uller for blessing their kills.\n\nUller and her followers avoid the sea, as they fear upsetting Njord by entering his domain.\n\n### Depiction\n\nUller appears elven, with long white hair and piercing eyes and long, angular features. She is depicted always dressed warmly, as her domain is over winter and the frigid cold, usually with her bow, Ephyxis, drawn.\n\n### Commandments\n\n- Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction.\n- Trust in yourself above all others. Liberty is paramount, but it cannot come at the cost of others’ freedom.\n- Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world.

She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth. And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it.”\n- “The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.”\n- “And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth.

About 150 years ago, in approximately  \n380 P.D., a clan of fierce Wolf warriors, the Úlfur  \nClan led by King Asger Úlfur, began coalescing  \npower and expanding their influence. Through a  \ncombination of raiding, diplomacy, and  \nmutually-beneficial arrangements, their power  \ngradually increased. Under the guidance of the  \ndivine beings Odin and Balder, the Úlfurs were  \nable to expand their civilization, make moderate  \nmagical advancements, grow more plentiful  \nfood and gain more powerful means of  \nprotection.  \n\nOther rulers have come and gone, but few have  \nmade as immediate and lasting a mark as King  \nHrothgar Úlfur and Queen Freya Úlfur. Aer  \nassuming the throne in 498 P.D., their rule was  \nimmediately threatened by a near world-ending  \ncataclysm that claimed the lives of many.  \nArmies led by Queen Freya (and divine  \nintervention) saved the world, and the citizens  \nof Úlfurfold are incredibly grateful to their king  \nand queen for their survival.  \nÚlfurfold has increased its military presence,  \nparticularly to the west of the continent.

(Post-Divergence). A century or so  \naer the cityʼs founding, the human society  \ndiscovered their Dwarvish neighbors to the  \nsouthwest and their Elven neighbors to the  \nsoutheast. The Elves and Dwarves, as well as  \nHalflings, and Goblins, Drow, Orcs and other  \ncreatures that have kept to the Underdark, have  \nbeen on Viken for centuries. Their civilizations  \nstretch back long before mankind, and they  \nhave known divine presence long before the  \nAesir Gods.  \n\nThe races have lived mostly peacefully on Viken.  \nApproximately 35 years before our campaign  \nbegan, in 500 P.D., there was a Great War  \nbetween the armies of Surtur and the people of  \nthe continent. It was a terrible war that  \nthreatened the very fabric of the world, and  \nanyone alive during that time remembers the  \nchaos and terror of those deadly months.  \nViken is divided up into 3 regions: The Kingdom  \nof Úlfurfold, the Kingdom of Men and the largest  \nKingdom on the continent, led by King Hrothgar  \nand Queen Freya; Tel-Quessir, the Kingdom of  \nthe Elves in the Savaliere Woods, led by Queen  \nKeyleth Siannodel; and the Black Sands Alliance,  \nan independent alliance of southern port towns  \nand cities under the protection of the Clovis  \nConcord.  \n\nAll citizens of Viken have grown up  \nexperiencing harsh winters, raging storms, and  \na terrible war only a generation ago. The people  \nof Úlfurfold, the kingdom where our story takes  \nplace, are tough, resilient, and adept at survival.  \nEven wizards and those who study the arcane  \ncan expect to have a reasonable amount of  \nsurvival skills, and probably know how to swing  \na sword if the situation demands it. All beings  \non Viken are used to cold, harsh winters broken  \nup by brief but tepid summers. Temperatures to  \nthe south of the continent tend to be more  \nmanageable, while up north they deal with  \nnearly year-long winters.\n\n# The Great War\n\nThe War of 500 P.D., a continent-spanning battle  \nthat threatened to tear apart the very fabric of  \nthe world itself, happened within living memory  \nof many of the older members of society.  \nHuman warriors and spellcasters joined with  \ndwarves to beat back the threat and seal Sultur  \nand his armies away. The elves of the Savaliere  \nWoods did not fight in the War, instead choosing  \nto shore up their defenses and keep Infernal  \nthreats from entering their woods. There is  \nsome tension between the races because of this  \nhistory, and while peace between the people has  \nheld, there is an air of distrust from most  \ninhabitants of Úlfurfold toward other  \ncivilizations, particularly the elves and the Black  \nSands Alliance.  \n\nIt is said that the Godsʼ intervention in that epic  \nbattle is the only thing that kept the armies of  \nSurtur from wiping out civilization. Since that  \nconflict, military presence has ramped up in  \nViken, particularly along the western border of  \nthe Kingdom of Úlfurfold.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.556060623Z","tags":null},"/Places/Wolf-Steel-Coster":{"title":"Wolf Steel Coster","content":"\n### Notes\n\n- Store in [Berufell](content/Places/Berufell.md)\n\n#stores ","lastmodified":"2022-12-21T02:12:54.560060541Z","tags":null},"/Places/Yggdrasil":{"title":"Yggdrasil","content":"\n A great ash tree also known as the World Tree, Yggdrasil’s branches wave above [Asgard](content/Places/Asgard.md).
