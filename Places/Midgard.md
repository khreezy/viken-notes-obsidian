The [[Midgard]], aka the mortal plane of existence. Many continents make up Midgard; our story is set on the continent of [[Viken]]. In addition to the [[Kingdom of Ãšlfurfold]], our world holds [[Jotunheim]], The Frozen North and the land of the frost giants; Muspelheim, The Wastes of Surtur and the land of the fire giants; the dwarf kingdom of Faerun; and Tel-Quessir in the Savaliere Woods, the domain of the high elves.
