# Description

An independent alliance to the south of Viken,  
the Black Sands Alliance encompasses all of the  
southern part of the continent below the MÃ½ri  
Swamp, including Felderwin, Gullborg, and Port  
Baro. The coastline along the south of the  
continent is made up of black sand and rocks,  
with jagged peaks overlooking crashing waves.  
The Black Sands Alliance is a collection of  
independent cities and towns, but the  
protectorate and governing body is called the  
Clovis Concord.
