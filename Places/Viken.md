# History

Humans arrived on Viken to a seemingly empty  
continent and founded the city of Kvikvik in  
about 20 P.D. (Post-Divergence). A century or so  
aer the cityʼs founding, the human society  
discovered their Dwarvish neighbors to the  
southwest and their Elven neighbors to the  
southeast. The Elves and Dwarves, as well as  
Halflings, and Goblins, Drow, Orcs and other  
creatures that have kept to the Underdark, have  
been on Viken for centuries. Their civilizations  
stretch back long before mankind, and they  
have known divine presence long before the  
Aesir Gods.  

The races have lived mostly peacefully on Viken.  
Approximately 35 years before our campaign  
began, in 500 P.D., there was a Great War  
between the armies of Surtur and the people of  
the continent. It was a terrible war that  
threatened the very fabric of the world, and  
anyone alive during that time remembers the  
chaos and terror of those deadly months.  
Viken is divided up into 3 regions: The Kingdom  
of Úlfurfold, the Kingdom of Men and the largest  
Kingdom on the continent, led by King Hrothgar  
and Queen Freya; Tel-Quessir, the Kingdom of  
the Elves in the Savaliere Woods, led by Queen  
Keyleth Siannodel; and the Black Sands Alliance,  
an independent alliance of southern port towns  
and cities under the protection of the Clovis  
Concord.  

All citizens of Viken have grown up  
experiencing harsh winters, raging storms, and  
a terrible war only a generation ago. The people  
of Úlfurfold, the kingdom where our story takes  
place, are tough, resilient, and adept at survival.  
Even wizards and those who study the arcane  
can expect to have a reasonable amount of  
survival skills, and probably know how to swing  
a sword if the situation demands it. All beings  
on Viken are used to cold, harsh winters broken  
up by brief but tepid summers. Temperatures to  
the south of the continent tend to be more  
manageable, while up north they deal with  
nearly year-long winters.

# The Great War

The War of 500 P.D., a continent-spanning battle  
that threatened to tear apart the very fabric of  
the world itself, happened within living memory  
of many of the older members of society.  
Human warriors and spellcasters joined with  
dwarves to beat back the threat and seal Sultur  
and his armies away. The elves of the Savaliere  
Woods did not fight in the War, instead choosing  
to shore up their defenses and keep Infernal  
threats from entering their woods. There is  
some tension between the races because of this  
history, and while peace between the people has  
held, there is an air of distrust from most  
inhabitants of Úlfurfold toward other  
civilizations, particularly the elves and the Black  
Sands Alliance.  

It is said that the Godsʼ intervention in that epic  
battle is the only thing that kept the armies of  
Surtur from wiping out civilization. Since that  
conflict, military presence has ramped up in  
Viken, particularly along the western border of  
the Kingdom of Úlfurfold.
