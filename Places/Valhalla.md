Valhalla is [[Odin]]’s vast hall in [[Asgard]]. It is home to all those slain in battle. Every day the rooster [[Gullinkambi]] (“Golden Comb”) wakes the fallen soldiers, and they venture out to fight each other in training for [[Ragnarok]], the final battle. Every evening those killed in the battle rise, whole and healed, to feast and be merry, until the next morning when their battle rages again.
