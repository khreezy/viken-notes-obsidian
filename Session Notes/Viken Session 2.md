- Started off by deciding to stuff the [[Baby Basilisk]] in [[Bug]]'s bag and taking it with us
- Escaped notice from the guards by [[Eir]] using presitidigitation and me using minor illusion to distract them while we ran out
- went to [[Sofia]] and [[Ekaterina]]'s shop, where Ekaterina advised us to finish our business with [[Pasha]]
- Went and dropped off the box of silvered weapons with [[Pasha]]
- [[Eir]] got some sort of magical broach as well as the gold in exchange
- Stayed the night at the [[Sootswallow Lodge]]
- In the morning, [[Fraeyda]] and I journeyed back to [[Ekaterina]]'s shop
- Before we left, [[Bug]] asked us to find a book on taking care of the [[Baby Basilisk]]
- When we arrived, [[Ekaterina]] asked us if we could look into her employee [[Sildar]]'s absence
    - she sent him to fetch an item from [[Berufell]] but he should have arrived two days ago and has not been seen since
- I bought a 100g worth of magical ink/paper and a scroll of identify
- Talked to my mom, [[Sofia]], who I haven't seen in 40 years. promised i would be back soon
- We left to meet the others at the south gate of Ifyr
- On the way, we stopped at [[The Dusty Tome]], where we bought [[Volo's Guide to Monsters]] for [[Bug]]
- Upon arriving at the gate, it became clear that it was one of the more heavily guarded gates because it is the closest to the [[Black Sands Alliance]]
- I attempted to cast a poorly planned illusion to give the appearance of a regular, open bag when we were going through the gate
- [[Eir]] had to come in and save be my charming the guard and distracting him into letting me through
- After making our way out of the city, we decided to skirt around and head towards [[Berufell]]
- The guards spotted us skirting the city and we were noted
- We traveled for the rest of the day until coming upon a overturned cart with dead horses and a sign for [[Ekaterina]]'s Esoterica on it
    - clearly this was [[Sildar]]'s cart
- We searched the cart but were then attacked by a few goblins
- We managed to kill the goblins easily, with [[Bug]] absolutely massacring one of them
- During the fight, [[Fraeyda]] healed a Dwarf who was unconscious in the wreckage, who proceeded to nut check a goblin to death
- Also during the fight, [[Eir]] caused a small fire in the woods. This seemed to anger [[Bug]] who then attacked [[Royson]]
- After the fight, the [[Baby Basilisk]] was squirming a lot and we unsuccessfully attempted to calm it down, whereupon it bit [[Bug]]'s finger and has just escaped the bag
    - we are planning on releasing the [[Baby Basilisk]] somewhere near [[Berufell]]
