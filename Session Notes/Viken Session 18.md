[[Fraeyda]] was wadnering the streets and found a long streak of mud

investigated it and found:

a putrid smell

twoish feet wide and stretches 10-15 feet down part of the road into a storm drain

couldn't see anything down the drain

apparently silvered weapons are not allowed in the [[Kingdom of Úlfurfold]]
