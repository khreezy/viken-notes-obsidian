    - I’m very sorry to hear you won’t be joining our most recent venture, Taskhand. I assure you, it promises extraordinary profits for the right investors. I ask only that you keep an open mind regarding the Northern Expedition. Perhaps, if we can prove the values of exploration, you will reconsider the participation of your people. And if the Court of Stars is uninterested in an official capacity, know that your private investment will always be welcome. Guildmaster Royson and I will keep our offer on the table through the end of the season, if you change your mind. - Councilor Snow
