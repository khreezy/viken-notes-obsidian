[[Markus]] found a tooth and bone necklace on the orc that he mind controlled

750 copper peices, 180 silver pieces, 90 gold pieces

[[Royson]] crochets

went into the cavern near the manor

[[Fraeyda]] is venturing into the cavern

room has two stone columns supporting it

there is a dark crevasse

hand with long taloned fingers says in [[Fraeyda]]'s head and says "hello"

manor is English Tudor style

very rundown

footprints that avoid the manor but come to the right of the kitchen and go towards the cellar doors

cellar doors are not in disrepair and are locked by a new lock
